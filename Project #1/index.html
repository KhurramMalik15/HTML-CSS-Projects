                    <h2>Missle Man of Pakistan</h2>
                    <p><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b>was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city then in the erstwhile British
                        Indian princely state of Bhopal State, and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a
                        Muhajir of Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin. His father, Abdul Ghafoor, was a
                        schoolteacher who once worked for the Ministry of Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a
                        housewife with a very religious mindset. His older siblings, along with other family
                        members, had emigrated to Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947, who would often write
                        to Khan's parents about the new life they had found in Pakistan.

                        After his matriculation from a local school in Bhopal, in 1952 Khan emigrated from India to
                        Pakistan on the Sind Mail train, partly due to the reservation politics:at that time,
                        and religious violence in India during his youth had left an indelible impression on his world
                        view. Upon settling in Karachi with his family, Khan briefly attended the D. J. Science
                        College before transferring to the University of Karachi, where he graduated in 1956 with a
                        Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics with a concentration on solid-state physics.

                        From 1956 to 1959, Khan was employed by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (city government)
                        as an Inspector of weights and measures, and applied for a scholarship that allowed him to study
                        in West Germany. In 1961, Khan departed for West Germany to study material science at
                        the Technical University in West Berlin, where he academically excelled in courses in
                        metallurgy, but left West Berlin when he switched to the Delft University of Technology in the
                        Netherlands in 1965.</p>
